To use the VMp2.py to translate a vm files to asm, type the following into the command line

python3 VMp1.py filename1 filname2 ... filenamen 

(this code assumes that filename ends in a .vm extension)

Where filename1 filname2 ... filenamen are all object files that need to be translated to assembly code 

no bugs I think
